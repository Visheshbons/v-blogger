## Reporting Issues

If the issue is minor, then feel free to open an issue.
However, if you feel that the issue is too major, then please email me directly at vishesh.kudva@outlook.com, and I will look into it.
Please remember that this is a hobby project that I made, and security is not my primary concern.
