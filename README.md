# V-Blogger

V-Blogger is a small project I made for fun. It has a basic interface, and supports anonymous posting. It currently only supports text posts, but this will change in the near future (if I remember).

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Automatic name signing with "anonymous" for non-account-holders
- Responsive design for all devices
- Hashed password storage
- User authentication with front-end pre-hashing

## Getting Started

You can visit a live demo [here](https://jm8jml4b-3000.aue.devtunnels.ms/) (This may not run, it is port forwarding), or you can run it on your own machine.
